# Coding Quiz Webpage
This is a simple quiz webpage built to help with learning to code. 
There are 5 questions listed currently, but more questions will be added as we learn more.

# How it works
When the user clicks on the "Start the Quiz" button, the questions are revealed one by one.
When a question is answered correctly, a message shows on the bottom of the question saying "Correct!"
When a question is answered wrong, in addition to a "Not Quite!" message, as a penalty, 15 seconds are reduced from the total time remaining. 
At the end of the questions, timer stops, and the score of the user is stored in the local storage and the user can submit their name to keep track of their progress in learning to code!
The high scores are listed in a page which is accessable through "View High Scores" button/link.
